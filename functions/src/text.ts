  'Red pandas can be easily identified by their unique ruddy coat color, which acts like camouflage within the canopy of fir trees where branches are covered with clumps of reddish-brown moss and white lichens.',
  'Red pandas share the giant pandaâ€™s pseudo-thumb, a modified wrist bone used to grasp bamboo when feeding.',
  'Red pandas are the only living member of the Ailuridae family!',
  'Red panda\'s taxonomic position has long been a subject of scientific debate. They were first described as members of the raccoon family. Later, due to some agreements in DNA, they were assigned to the bear family. Most recent genetic research, however, places red pandas in their own, independent family: Ailuridae',
  'Adult red pandas typically weigh between 8 and 17 pounds (3.6 and 7.7 kilograms) and are 22 to 24.6 inches (56 to 62.5 centimeters) long, plus a tail of 14.6 to 18.6 inches (37 to 47.2 centimeters).',
  'Red pandas are roughly the size of a large domestic cat.',
  'The red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas, and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east',
  'While originally thought to be two subspecies, new genetic studies suggest that there are two distinct species of red panda: Ailurus fulgens fulgens (Chinese) and Ailurus fulgens styani (Himalayan) (also known as Ailurus fulgens refulgens). The latter tends to be larger and deeper red in color than the former.',
  'Red pandas stand on their hind legs! While an upright panda may be cute, this is actually a defense mechanism as red pandas will often stand up to appear larger when provoked or threatened. They will also let out their loudest call: WAAH.',
  'Red pandas have a sweet tooth! They prefer artificial sugars to plain or naturally sweetened bowls of water.',
  'Red pandas have different names depending on where you are. In Nepal, they\'re called bhalu biralo. Sherpas call the critter ye niglva ponva or wah donka.',
  'In south-west China, red pandas are hunted for their fur, especially for the highly valued bushy tails, from which hats are produced. In these areas, the fur is often used for local cultural ceremonies. In weddings, the bridegroom traditionally carries the hide. The "good-luck charm" red panda-tail hats are also used by local newly-weds.',
